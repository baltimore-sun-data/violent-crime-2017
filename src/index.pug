					h1 Violent crime in Baltimore, 2012 - 2017
					p Violent crime in Baltimore spiked after 2015. That year, homicides jumped 62 percent to 344, a figure unseen since the ‘90s. Carjackings, shootings, and commercial robberies all skyrocketed as overall violent crime rose 7.6 percent.
					p Three years since that pivotal year, overall violent crime continues to climb in the city. Below, we look at how violent crime has changed in two distinct time periods — the three years before 2015 and the three years since.

					p These three year segments, from 
						span 2012 to 2014 
						| and 
						span 2015 to 2017
						| , were chosen to highlight a turning point in recent city history.
					p From 2012 to 2014, the city saw steadily declining numbers in violent crime. Since then, in the past three years, numbers have increased. As the third year closes with this continuing trend, the city appears to have entered a new norm of increased violent crime.
					p Overall violent crime between these two time periods is up 9.5 percent. Most categories of violent crime either increased or stayed about the same, with the biggest percentage growths in homicides, shootings and robberies.
