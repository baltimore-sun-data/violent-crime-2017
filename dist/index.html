          <p>Violent crime in Baltimore spiked after 2015. That year, homicides jumped 62 percent to 342, a level previously unseen since the 1990s. Carjackings, shootings and commercial robberies all skyrocketed as overall violent crime rose 9.8 percent.</p>
          <p>Two years after that pivotal year, overall violent crime continues to climb in the city. Below, we look at how violent crime has changed in two distinct time periods — the three years before 2015 and the past three years.</p>

          <p>Most commercial robberies since 2012 occurred around the downtown area and major roads throughout the city. Similar to street robberies, downtown commercial robberies occured at twice the rate as the next neighborhood.</p>
          <p>Roads targeted most include York Road, Reisterstown Road, Harford Road, Belair Road, and Pulaski Highway.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, residential robberies are one of the few types of violent crime that went down over the past few years. Between 2015 and 2017, it’s dropped by about 4 percent.</p>
